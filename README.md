# Sargas - Investigation Board

A corkboard for collaborative investigation in **Foundry VTT V14**. Players pin clues, string them
together, and work cases as a party — no GM required at the table.

## Installation

Paste this manifest URL into Foundry's **Add-on Modules → Install Module**:

```
https://github.com/sargas79/sargas-investigation-board/releases/latest/download/module.json
```

Then enable **Sargas - Investigation Board** in your world's module settings.

### Upgrading from 1.0.1 or earlier

Up to 1.0.1 the module's id was `investigation-board`, which another package on the Foundry
registry already uses, so Foundry's **Update** button replaced this module with that one. The id
is now `sargas-investigation-board`. Foundry treats that as a different module, so upgrading is a
one-time reinstall:

1. Uninstall the old **Sargas - Investigation Board** (or whatever the update replaced it with).
   Your worlds' cases are stored in the worlds, not the module, so nothing is lost.
2. Install again from the manifest URL above, and enable it in each world.
3. The first time a GM loads each world, the module moves its cases, handouts and settings over
   to the new id and asks everyone to refresh.

## Opening the board

- The thumbtack in the **token scene controls**
- **Shift+I**
- `game.modules.get("sargas-investigation-board").api.open()` from a macro

## Working a case

**Start one** with **New Case** in the sidebar. You choose there and then whether it's yours alone,
something the party can watch, or something everyone can work on — see [Sharing](#sharing) for why
that choice is offered up front.

**Pin evidence** from the toolbar, or drag an **Actor, Item or Scene from the sidebar** straight
onto the cork. A dropped document is *linked*, not copied: rename an NPC and the clue still points
at them, and the link marker on the card opens the original.

Every clue records **the character who pinned it** — not the account name, so a board reads as the
party wrote it. The name sits on the card and in the inspector, with the time it was pinned. Both
the actor and the name as it stood are kept, so a rename follows through while a player swapping
character mid-campaign doesn't silently rewrite who found what.

**Jot a lead** with Create Lead — one click drops a sticky note with the caret already in it.

**Annotate a clue** with *Add note* in the inspector. The note window doesn't lock the rest of
Foundry, so you can copy from a journal, the chat or a sheet and paste straight in. Hover a note to
edit or delete it: players change their own notes, the GM anyone's. An edited note says so in its
byline.

**String clues together** with the Draw Connection tool (click one clue, then another; it stays on
so you can tie several in a row) or by dragging straight from a clue's pushpin. **Hand**, the first
tool in the bar, puts whatever is in use back down: it drops the linking tool, abandons a
half-drawn string and closes the filter panel, leaving the plain pointer you started with. Cut a string by
selecting it and pressing Delete, or right-clicking it. Strings take the colour of the pin they
start from, so a line of enquiry reads as one colour across the board.

**Follow a string** from the **Strings** list in the inspector: each row names the clue at the far
end, and clicking that name selects it and brings it into view. A chain of reasoning can be walked
end to end from the panel, without hunting for the next card by eye. The board only moves if the
clue was off-screen — a corkboard is a spatial memory, and it should not rearrange itself under
you when what you asked for was already in front of you.

**Set clues aside** with Delete or the right-click menu. They go to the **Discarded** tray and come
back with every string they were tied to still attached — dismissing is never destructive.

**Close a case** with the box icon in the header; it moves to Archived and can be reopened. A GM
also gets a trash icon, in the header and on each row of the sidebar, which destroys the case and
everything on it after a confirmation that says how many clues go with it.

**Open the case file** with the folder icon in the header, or by double-clicking a case's name in
the sidebar or its title in the header. The board is where the party works a
case out; the file is what they write down — an opening document with a file number and the facts
of the case, then findings pages added as sessions go on. Anyone who can work the case writes the
opening file — shared means shared, and the file is the record of work the whole party did. Anyone
who can work the case can add a finding too, and edits only their own. A GM who wants something in
the file the party cannot rewrite has redaction, below.

**Redaction** is the GM's. Selecting a passage and redacting it *moves the text out* of the page
into a companion document players have no permission on — so a player's browser has no copy at all,
not merely a hidden one. Revealing moves it back. This matters: neither `gmOnlyFields` nor page
ownership would have done it, because the first only guards writes and the second only filters
display, leaving the text sitting on the player's client either way.

**Filter** the board to find things. Non-matching clues *dim* rather than disappear, so the layout
never moves: a board is a spatial memory, and "the watch is bottom-right, next to the map" should
stay true.

### Keyboard

The board can be worked without a mouse. With the cork focused: **arrows** pan (hold Shift to go
further), **+**/**−** zoom, **0** resets. With a card focused: **Enter** opens it, **L** starts a
string and Enter on another card finishes it, **Delete** sets it aside. **Escape** unwinds whatever
is in progress, one step at a time.

## Documents

Beside the case list, the board's **Documents** tab holds the papers the GM writes in advance and
hands over when the party earns them: death records, company badges, newspaper clippings, police
records, identity cards.

**Writing one.** *New Document* on the Documents tab. Pick a kind and it seeds the blanks that kind
usually wants — a death record starts with Deceased, Date of Death, Cause; a badge with Name,
Position, Employee No. Those are only a starting point: add lines, remove them, rename them. Every
document also takes an issuing authority, a reference number, a dateline written however it reads
in the fiction, a picture, and a block of text. On the kinds that describe a person the picture is
shown as a photograph beside the details; on the rest it is a full-width scan of the paper.

**One case at a time.** The Documents tab lists the open case's documents only. A new document is
filed under the case open when it was written; change that with *Case* in the document's editor, or
choose *Every case*. A document also appears under any case it has been pinned to. Documents written
before 1.5.0 have no case recorded: they appear under the cases they are pinned to, or under every
case if they are pinned nowhere.

**A document you have written is yours alone.** It does not appear for any player, anywhere, until
you hand it over — not greyed out, not hidden behind a permission check: their client is never sent
it at all. See *Permissions* below for why that distinction matters.

**Handing it over.** The hand icon beside a document opens the hand-over dialog: tick individual
players, or the whole party. The icon lights up for a document that is out, and hovering it says
who is holding it. Players you hand a document to do not need to be logged in — it is waiting for
them when they connect. Unticking everyone takes it back.

**What the players do with it.** A handed-over document appears in the player's own Documents tab,
and opens as the document itself. The thumbtack beside it pins it to the open case as an ordinary
clue card, which can be strung to anything else on the board — as can dragging it from the tab onto
the cork. The card carries a *link* to the document, never a copy of it, so a player pinning
something you gave to them alone does not thereby publish it to the rest of the party: the others
see a card saying such a paper exists, and reading it still takes having been given it.

Taking a document back leaves cards already on the board where they are, with the name and picture
they were pinned with. Only the link stops opening.

## Sharing

A case starts out belonging to whoever made it. How it gets shared depends on one quirk of
Foundry's permission model, which is worth understanding:

**Foundry's server refuses a non-GM any change to a document's ownership after it exists** — but it
*permits* setting it at the moment of creation. So:

- **Choosing "the whole party" when you create a case needs no GM at all.** This is the path to
  prefer.
- **Changing who can see a case afterwards needs a GM or Assistant GM online.** The Share dialog
  relays the request to their client, which re-checks that you own the case before applying it.

A case's own player always keeps it, and every GM always keeps access, so sharing can never orphan
a case or lock out the only people who could repair it.

## Permissions

| Action | Who |
|---|---|
| Add, edit, move, dismiss clues; string and cut | Anyone with **Owner** on the case |
| Write the case file's opening document | Anyone with **Owner** on the case |
| Add a finding to the case file | Anyone with **Owner** on the case — each edits only their own |
| Redact or reveal a passage | **GM or Assistant GM** |
| View only | **Observer** |
| Create or import a case | Needs **Create Journal Entries** — the **Trusted Player** rank has it by default |
| Share an existing case | **GM or Assistant GM** |
| Write, edit, hand over or delete a document | **GM or Assistant GM** |
| Read a document, and pin it to a case | Whoever it has been **handed to** |
| Edit or delete a note on a clue | Its **author** (with **Owner** on the case), or the **GM** |
| Change which character a clue is credited to | **GM or Assistant GM**, from the pencil beside the clue's byline in the inspector. Each change is listed there with the previous name |
| Delete a clue permanently | **GM only**, from the Discarded tray — players set aside instead |
| Delete a case permanently | **GM only**, from the header or the sidebar — players close instead |

**Recommended setup: give your players the Trusted Player rank.** They can then create cases, share
them with the party at creation, and import cases, all without a GM online. Editing clues never
needs one either way — the board works with the GM away.

If a player lacks the permission, a connected GM's client will create the case for them as a
fallback, but that means waiting for a GM to be online.

**On GM-only deletion:** the guard runs on the client attempting the delete, so it stops every path
through the interface and any accident. It cannot stop a player deliberately calling the API from
the browser console — Foundry grants an Owner delete rights, and revoking those would mean relaying
every clue edit through a GM and breaking offline-GM play. Players get **Set aside** and **Close
case**, which keep everything recoverable.

**On documents being genuinely hidden:** a handout is a JournalEntry of its own rather than a page
inside a shared one, and that is not tidiness — it is the whole mechanism. Foundry enforces
ownership on *top-level* documents: a document a player has no permission on is never sent to their
client. Page-level ownership only filters the *display*; the page is still in their client and can
be read from the browser console. So an unshared handout is not a document a player is stopped from
opening, it is a document they do not have. This is the same reasoning behind redacted passages,
which are moved into a GM-only companion entry for exactly the same reason.

Handing a document over grants **Observer**, not Owner: the player reads it and works from it, and
cannot rewrite the coroner's report or delete it out of the campaign.

Image upload needs **Upload Files** (Assistant GM by default). Without it, the image picker falls
back to browsing existing files or pasting a path.

**Where uploads go.** Every image uploaded through the board is written to `leads/` inside the
world's own folder — `Data/worlds/<your world>/leads` — whichever directory the picker happens to
be showing, and the folder is created the first time it is needed. Browsing stays unrestricted, so
an image already somewhere in the world can still be picked. One folder inside the world is the
only sensible home for these: Foundry's server refuses an upload into any world but the running
one, a module's own directory is wiped when the module updates, and evidence scattered across
whatever folder each player last opened is no use to the next GM. Images dropped or pasted
directly into a clue's *rich text* body are core's own feature and still go where core puts them,
beside the journal entry.

## Moving a case between worlds

**Export Case** writes a JSON file; **Import** reads one back. The board and the case file both
travel — clues, where they sit, the strings between them, the discarded tray, the opening document
and every finding.

Handouts are not part of a case and do not travel with one; a card pinned from a document exports
as a plain card, since the link would mean nothing in the destination world.

Three things deliberately stay behind. Ownership and links to documents are meaningless in another
world, where those users and documents don't exist. **Redacted passages** are left out on purpose:
they live in a GM-only document precisely so they are absent from anything a player could obtain,
and writing them into a portable file would undo that in a single step. The bars still appear in
the destination world, with nothing behind them.

The **deduction ledger** (below) is left out too, unless a GM ticks *Include the GM's deduction
ledger* when exporting. A player's export never has it, and leaves the deduction stamps behind as
well.

## GURPS Monster Hunters: deductions

With **Rules: GURPS Monster Hunters** switched on in the module settings, the board runs
investigations with the rules from *Monster Hunters 2: The Mission* (pp. 5–11). Off by default, so
tables playing anything else see no change.

**Stamping a clue.** When the GM selects a clue, the inspector gets a *Deduction* section: tick what
it is evidence of (**Who, What, When, Where, Why**), choose its weight (minor +0, normal +1, found on
a critical +2, major +2 or more) and **Stamp and log**. The card then wears a rubber stamp every
player can see. The bonus it gave stays with the GM. As the rules say, stamping rolls those
deductions for the whole team right away.

**The tracker** (magnifying glass in the header, GM only) keeps the rest:

- **Deductions**: each one's difficulty, set from the book's options with page references, plus
  the clue bonus, confusion, and the +4 for a correct guess or a known address. It also shows the
  skills that can roll it, what each level of success reveals, and the best result so far.
- **Clues**: everything counted, plus clues that never reached the board (an interview, a phone
  call).
- **Team**: the investigators. Skill levels are read from GURPS Game Aid character sheets, wildcard
  skills included, and the GM can override any of them. Lucky guesses and the other
  once-per-adventure uses are tracked here.
- **Sources**: Beating a Dead Horse, with the penalty on the next try at each source.
- **Roll log** and a condensed **Reference** of the ways to dig up clues.

Rolls are made by the module and whispered to the GMs. After a critical failure it makes the
verification roll, and tells the GM plainly when they should give false information.

The ledger lives on the case's GM-only companion entry, the same place redacted passages go, so a
player's client is never sent it.

## How it is stored

A case is an ordinary **JournalEntry** flagged as one. Each clue and each string is a
**JournalEntryPage** of a module sub-type. A handout is a **JournalEntry of its own**, flagged as
one, holding a single page of the handout sub-type — its own entry because that is the only level
at which Foundry's server withholds a document from a client.

That is deliberate: ownership, folders, compendium export, permissions and multi-client sync all
come from Foundry core rather than being rebuilt. It also means two players moving different clues
never collide, because they are writing to different documents.

Cases, handouts and sealed entries are filed in a **Cases** folder in the journal directory rather
than mixed in with your own journals. The GM's client creates the folder when the world starts and,
the first time, moves in any of the module's journals still sitting at the top level — journals
you have already filed elsewhere are left alone. The folder is recognised by a flag, so you can
rename it. Turn **File Journals in a Cases Folder** off in the module settings to go back to the
top level; journals already filed stay where they are.

Dragging a clue writes **one** update, when you let go — not one per pointer move — so a board
stays usable over a network. Who is holding which card travels over the module socket instead of
the database, and expires on its own if someone disconnects mid-drag.

## Development

Plain ESM, no build step.

```bash
node test/run.mjs              # validates against your own Foundry install
node tools/preview-server.mjs  # a workbench for the board, with no Foundry needed
```

The test harness loads Foundry's own `common/` code, so the manifest and data models are checked by
the same schemas the server uses. It looks for Foundry at `E:/Foundry Virtual Tabletop/resources/app`;
override with `FOUNDRY_APP=/path/to/resources/app`.

With the preview server running, `/tools/preview/case.html` is a full board and exposes in-browser
suites (`runInteractionTests()`, `runLinkingTests()`, `runTrayTests()`, `runDropTests()`,
`runBoardRendererTests()`); `/cards.html` is the template gallery and `/strings.html` the connection
layer.

Releases are cut by pushing a `v*` tag. The workflow refuses to publish if the tag and
`module.json` disagree.
